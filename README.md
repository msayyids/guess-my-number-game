This is a simple browser-based number guessing game. In this game, a number is randomly generated, and the player selects a number between 1 and 20, trying to guess the generated number. Each time the player makes a guess, they will be informed whether their guess is too high or too low, and they start with an initial score of 20. The score decreases each time the player makes a wrong guess.
